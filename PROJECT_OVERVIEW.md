## üåü Core Value Proposition

### The Problem We Solve
Sports bettors face several critical challenges:
1. **Poor record keeping** - Most bettors track bets haphazardly (if at all)
2. **No bankroll discipline** - Betting without proper money management leads to losses
3. **Lack of analytics** - Can't identify profitable patterns or losing strategies
4. **Manual data entry** - Tedious to log every bet detail
5. **No accountability** - Easy to forget losses and overestimate wins

### Our Solution
BetSnap provides a complete betting management ecosystem that combines:
- **AI-powered bet extraction** from screenshots (no manual typing!)
- **Professional bankroll management** with unit sizing and risk controls
- **Advanced analytics** to identify profitable betting patterns
